        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            For this project we are planning to create a web application that assists school administrators in keeping track of elementary aged childrens' after school plans, and gives parents an easy way to update their child's after-school schedule. Our main goal is to make communications between the front office, teachers, and parents a seamless process. Our project idea comes from the needs of a real elementary school administrator, and our name is inspired by the mascot of that elementary school, the Wilkes Whales.
        </p>

        <h2>Usefulness</h2>
        <p>
            Our application is useful because it fulfills a need that hasn’t been met. Elementary school
            administrators find themselves using several different Google Sheets to keep track of information critical to the logistics of school every day. They also constantly field phone calls
            about mundane schedule switches, and then have to change information on several sheets
            with the same student information grouped in different ways. WhaleWatchr will be useful
            because it will smooth this clunky process into one as easy as it should be, by making
            data available in different formats to different users, and allowing parents to communicate
            their child’s schedule changes without needing to call if they are unable. For parents that
            prefer calling, WhaleWatchr will still streamline the process for the administrator in charge
            of keeping track of this information. There are some applications on the market aimed
            towards after-school programs to help them manage attendance and enrollment, but there
            is nothing specifically aimed at organizing the logistics of after-school plans for elementary
            school administrators.
        </p>

        <h2>Realness</h2>
        <p>
            Our data will be class rosters in excel format. Much of our data will be user-generated,
            as schedules will start empty until administrators and parents fill them in. Luckily, the
            required data to test our application is also relatively easy to generate ourselves, as the
            information going into the system consists of names and grades, which can both be easily
            randomly generated. We have access to the format of the data, and will model our own
            after it. The end goal is having an excel sheet downloaded from the elementary school’s
            central system with information for each child in the school.
        </p>

        <h2>Functionality</h2>

        <h3>Basic Functions</h3>
        <p>
            We are planning to create an interface that allows the administrator to see student information grouped in different ways, such as by teacher or bus number/after school plan. There
            will also be a parent, teacher, and bus driver view, which will show information that is pertinent only to that user. We will make it possible for parents to make changes to their child’s
            schedule which will then be confirmed by an administrator. We also want to incorporate a
            weekly schedule for each child. The database specifications underlying these functions will
            require basic queries, and will thus fulfill our basic functionality requirement.
        </p>

        <h3>Advanced Functions</h3>
        <h4>Google Authentication</h4>
        <p>
            An advanced function that we feel is paramount for making our application usable is making
            it possible for users to authenticate using a Google account. We recognize that many schools
            currently make use of the Google Suite because of how well it is integrated, and how familiar
            the interfaces are for teachers and administrators. Allowing our users to authenticate with a
            Google account will help to make the platform feel integrated for users, and less of an extra
            software they need to learn and get in the habit of using. This will make the transition from
            using google sheets to WhaleWatchr much easier for teachers and administrators.
        </p>

        <h4>iPhone Application</h4>
        <p>
            Another feature we feel is important to the success of our final product is having a mobile
            application tailored towards specific functions. We want to make this an easy way for parents
            to change their child’s plan wherever they are. We believe this will add value to parents
            lives, as many are working and may not be able to call the school at any time during the
            day. The WhaleWatchr mobile app will give a parent the ability to quickly change their
            child’s plan even if they are in a meeting or simply not at home. We also plan to have
            an administrator view for the mobile application that will allow them to confirm incoming
            changes, which is information that may be important to see even if the administrator is
            not at their desk at that moment. This will also allow for the use of notifications, which is
            something that a fully browser based application lacks, but may be important if schedule
            changes are last minute and the school needs to be notified quickly.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion, we feel we have a strong project idea with a real application in a niche that
            is unfulfilled. We are confident that we can create a product that works well and provides
            value for all parties involved.
